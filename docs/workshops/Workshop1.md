2. [Generating and Visualising Data](#2-generating-and-visualising-data)
3. [Data Collection with Arduino](#3-data-collection-with-arduino)

# 1. Tools: Atom, Python and Git

## 1.1 Atom

The first tool we need is a code editor, commonly called IDE for integrated
development editor. For this we will use Atom, as it is open source and popular 
for its modularity. 

Download and start Atom <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Atom has the typical features of an IDE, we will go through them during this workshop.
The first of them is the terminal. A terminal is a text-based interface we use
to enter and execute commands on a computer. While we will maximise the use of
graphical tools, we will also use the terminal in some occasion.

On the top menu, go to Packages > Settings View > Install Packages/Themes

Search for 'terminal plus' and install the first one 'platformio-ide-terminal'

Now you can open a terminal by clicking on the + sign in the bottom left corner.


## 1.2 Python

Python is the main programming language we will use throughout this course. To
execute Python code on your machine, you need to install a Python interpreter.
We will use Python 3.x (as opposed to 2.x).

In Atom, open a terminal and type in the following command

```bash
python3 --version
```

If the command results is 'Not found', you need to install Python 3.
Otherwise, skip the rest of this section.

Select, download and install the latest version of Python 3 for Windows or Mac
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### On Windows

Once installed go to Start > System > Properties > Advanced System Properties > Environment Variable

In User Variables, double click on 'Path'. At the end of the line, add a semi-colon followed by:

C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME by your Windows user name)

Close and reopen the Atom to check the installation

```bash
python --version
```

### On Mac 

Close and reopen the Atom to check the installation

```bash
python3 --version
```

## 1.2.1 Dependencies

In python Pip is a tool that manages packages for us. We will use it to install
and update any Python library our project relies on. You can install it with
the following command:

### On Mac

```bash
python3 get-pip.py
```

### On Windows

Download the file <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" target="_blank">get-pip.py</a>
and save it (CMD+S or Ctrl+S) in your Downloads folder. In the Atom terminal, type in the
following command:

```bash
python Downloads\get-pip.py
```

## 1.3 Python in Atom

The next step is the Python plugin for Atom, to get some help from in Atom
specifically for Python. Go to the terminal and type:

```bash
python -m pip install 'python-language-server[all]'
```

When it is installed, on the top menu of Atom, click on *'Packages' > 
'Settings View' > 'Install Packages/Themes'*. Search and install 'atom-ide-ui'
and 'ide-python'.

## 1.4 Git & GitHub

Git is a version control system (VCS). It helps keeping track of all changes
in your project and share it. While it is heavily used by software developers to
track and share code, it is also useful to track and share the progress of any
design or research process. The principle is as follows: you share a remote
repository, you 'pull' from this repository the latest changes (any files, code,
doc...) from your peers, you make changes on your machine, and you 'push' your
changes on the remote repository, making them available for your peers.

Here are four short videos with more details:

* <a href="https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control" target="_blank">What is version control</a>
* <a href="https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git" target="_blank">What is git</a>
* <a href="https://git-scm.com/video/get-going" target="_blank">Get Going</a>
* <a href="https://git-scm.com/video/quick-wins" target="_blank">Quick wins</a>

### Install Git

Windows / Mac

GitHub is a popular online platform that hosts remote Git repositories.
We will use it throughout the course to host your repo

### Sign up on GitHub

If you do not have GitHub account, sign up 
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Fork repository (only one member of the group)

*'A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely
experiment with changes without affecting the original project.'*
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/" target="_blank">(GitHub Help)</a>

On the top-right corner of this GitHub page, click on Fork. In the dialog,
select your account. You have now a copy of the wheelchair-design-platform
repository on your own account.

### Add members to repo __**(only one member of the group)**__

Your repository is publicly accessible for reading. However, you need to give
other member of the group access to this repository. On the top menu, click 
*'Settings' > 'Collaborators'*. Search the username of your group members and add them.

### Create a project

GitHub offers a convenient way of managing your projects with a Kanban style
board. On the top menu, click on 'Projects' and click on the green button 'New
Project'. Fill in a project name, select the template 'Basic Kanban' and click
'Create project'. You can use this space to map your tasks and your progress.

### Clone repository (all group members)

*'When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You
can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync
between the two locations.'*
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/" target="_blank">(GitHub Help)</a>

On GitHub, at the top of you repository, click on the green button 'Clone or
download' and copy the provided link.

Go back to Atom the terminal, and type in 'git clone' followed by the link you copied.
For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/wheelchair-design-platform.git
```

## 1.5 Project in Atom

To open the project you cloned, on the top menu click on 'File' > 'Open...' and
select the folder you cloned. On the left panel, you can see the files of your
project. Let's have a closer look:

* .git folder contains the all history of your project, managed by git. Do not
edit or delete files in this folder;
* platform contains all documents and code examples to get started;
* .gitignore contains the list of files/file extensions you do not want to track
with Git. It is especially convenient for local configuration or passwords not 
to be shared;
* LICENSE contains the MIT license for this project;
* README.md contains a short introduction to the platform in Markdown. Markdown 
is a lightweight markup language, i.e. minimal set tags to format text;
* requirements.txt contains the list of python library you need to install for
the project to work;

## 1.6 Git Flow

To experience the Git flow of updating and sharing progress, let's update the
 project documentation.

### Step 1: Edit (a) File(s)

When developing, it is common to document the project using Markdown. In Markdown,
we use '#' for titles and '*' for bullet points. More formatting can be found
[here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Open README.md and add a title at the top of the file, for example:

```markdown
# A Noisy Wheelchair

A short description...

# Wheelchair Design Platform
...

```

Note: A blue dot appear next to your file name README.md at the top of the page,
letting you know it is not saved. Press Command+S (or Ctrl+S) to save.

### Step 2: Stage, i.e Select File Changes

Your file appears in yellow in the left panel. It means that there are changes
in this file that are not yet tracked by Git (unstaged). Click on Git in the
bottom-right corner.

In the 'Unstaged changes', double-click on the README.md to 'stage' it, i.e. 
prepare this file to track its changes. The middle tab show you what are the
changes;

### Step 3: Commit, i.e Record Changes Locally

Then we add a 'Commit message' to briefly explain the nature of those changes,
e.g. 'a test of Git and Markdown'. Click on 'Commit to Master' to track the changes.
You have made one change (commit) to your local repository;

### Step 4: Push, i.e  Send Local Changes to GitHub

The final step consists in sharing this change with your peers. In the bottom-right
corner, click on 'push'.

### Step 5: Fetch (or Pull), i.e Get the Latest Changes from GitHub

Other members of the group can now press 'Fetch' in the bottom-right corner to 
update their local repository with the latest version.

## 1.7 Data-Centric Design Hub (Per group)

In the cloud we will use our prototyped cloud platform for designer we call 
Data-Centric Design Hub.

* Person have a collection of Things;
* Things are physical or virtual entities with Properties.
* Properties are one-to-many dimensional data points

In our wheelchair case, we have one Thing (the wheelchair) with properties such
as acceleration (3 values for x, y and z) or sit pressure (a value for each force
sensors on the sit).

Go to the hub manager via <a href="https://dwd.tudelft.nl/manager" target="_blank">dwd.tudelft.nl/manager</a>
and sign up as a group with an email address, a name and a password. The sign up
process create an account, then standard OAuth2 process start with a consent: you
need to let the manager access your Things, so that it can help you manage them.

Once the consent succeed, you can click on 'My Things' and create a first one.
For example with the name 'My wheelchair', type 'Wheelchair',
description 'An Internet-connected wheelchair'

The process take a few seconds as the hub generate an access token for your Thing.

**COPY AND SAVE THIS TOKEN** in a file, it will be shown only once and enable
your wheelchair to communicate with the hub. You can also save the thing id, but
you can always go back to the manager to retrieve this id.


# 2. Generating and Visualising Data

Back to Atom and your project, let's create a first Python example.

## 2.1 Dependencies

We use Pip to install the dependencies we need, listed in the file requirements.txt.
This file contains a dependence to the library writen for the Data-Centric Design
Hub as well as the a dependence for MQTT, a communication protocol we use to
talk to the hub.

Open the Atom terminal from the top menu 'View > Terminal > New Terminal Window'
and execute the following command.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

Here we 'install', the option -r indicates we provide a file name that contains 
the required dependencies, the option --user indicates we install the dependencies
in a dependency folder specific for the current users.

## 2.2 Get Started Code Example

On the left panel, right click on the root folder > New Folder and name it 'wheelchair'.

Copy the file examples > raspberrypi > get_started.py 
in your 'wheelchair' folder.

Opening this file, this Python code import the necessary library, then we can see
the following lines:

```python
THING_ID = os.environ['THING_ID']
THING_TOKEN = os.environ['THING_TOKEN']
```

In Python, it means we look at the environment variables to read the id and
access token of our thing. To provide these information as environment variable,
right click at the root of your project (left panel) and create a file '.env'.

In this file, type in the following and paste your id and access token after
the equal signs.

```bash
THING_ID=
THING_TOKEN=
```

Note: We do not want to track the file '.env' with Git as it contains secrets. To
avoid any mistake, the file .gitignore list all files, folders and extensions to
ignore. You will fine '.env' in the list.

## 2.3 Read through the Python Code

Going back to the get_started.py Python script, read through the code and comments
to capture the main steps:

* Create and connect a Thing to the Hub
* Retrieve and display the Thing details
* If the Thing is not containing any property, create a dum property
* In any case, retrieve this dum property
* Continuously call a method that generate dum data and send them to the hub

Here are a few Python elements to note:

* Use # in Python to comment your code
* my_thing and my_property are variables
* To display information in the terminal, we use the method print()

```python
print("show text")
```

* Conditional statement: In Python we express the condition with 'if', elif
(else if) and else (more details 
<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_if_else.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.

In our case, we check if the thing details we retrieved from the server has no property
(a newly created Thing) and then create a dum property.

```python
if len(my_thing.properties) == 0:
    # create a dum property
```

* Indentation is key in Python. Take the previous example of condition, the indentation
define what is in the condition. Any following line align with the if would be
considered outside the condition.

## 2.4 Execute the Python code

Let's execute this code. Go to the Atom terminal and type in the following command:

On Mac

```bash
python3 wheelchair/getStarted.py
```

On Windows



If the example run properly you should see a log generated every two seconds,
indicating dum data is being sent to the Hub.

## 2.5 Visualise Data on Grafana

To visualise this data, we use Grafana.

Go to the <a href="https://dwd.tudelft.nl/grafana" target="_blank">dwd.tudelft.nl/grafana</a>,
click on 'Sign in with OAuth'. Fill in your Data-Centric design Hub email and
password. Similarly to the manager, consent to let Grafana access your data.


Go to 'Dashboard > Manage' and create a new folder for your project.
Then, create a new Dashboard and select a new panel 'Graph'. At the top of this
new panel, click on 'Panel Title > Edit'

At the bottom, in the query element GROUP BY, click on time and 'remove'.

In FROM, click on 'Select Measurement' and select your Property ID. If your 
Property ID is not appearing in the list, the hub is not receiving data from
your python code.

In SELECT, click on field and select Value1. Then click on the 
+ sign > Fields > Field to add Value2 and Value3.


Back in the Atom terminal, stop your Python script with CMD+C (Ctrl+C).

# 3. Data Collection with Arduino

So far, we use our laptop to generate random data and send them to the cloud. As
it is too big and power intensive to fit on the wheelchair, we need a smaller computer
to run the same code on the wheelchair. To this end, in workshop 2 we will setup
a Raspberry Pi (i.e. a small computer) to run this code directly on the wheelchair.

For now, we will use your laptop to do this job and implement an example of actual
data collection. In this section we will log short and long press events of a push
button. It highlights that a sensor-based data point can be as simple as a button
event and tell us about how a user make use of it.

## 3.1 Install Arduino IDE

Similar to Atom, Arduino IDE is an editor with a convenient set of tools to programme
Arduino-like devices. You can download and install the latest version from
<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank">here</a>.

## 3.2 Push Button Example

In Atom, copy the folder examples > arduino > push_button_led_log
in your 'wheelchair' folder. Then, open this folder in Arduino IDE.

Looking at the code, we recognise the Arduino-like structure in three blocks:

* Declaration of variables and libraries, available throughout the code.
Note by convention, the constant are in uppercase (variable that will not change
during the programme) while other variables are in lowercase.

```cpp
int BUTTON_PIN = 22; // choose the input pin for the push button
int LED_PIN = 13;    // Choose the output pin for the LED

long LONG_PRESS_TIME = 500; // How long is a 'long press' (minimum, in ms)

long buttonActiveSince = 0; // Since when the button has been pressed (in ms since Arduino started)
boolean longPressActive = false; // Are we currently in a 'long press' event
```

* The setup() method executed once when the Arduino start;

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT);    // declare pushbutton as input
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);      // declare LED as input

  Serial.begin(9600); // setting baud speed for Serial (a baud is a pulse)
  
  // 'print' on the Serial port, i.e send a message through the serial port
  Serial.println("Lets start using the button!");
}
```

* The Loop() method executed infinitely after the setup method.

```cpp
void loop() {
  // Is button active?
  if (digitalRead(button) == LOW) {
    // if the button was not yet pressed
    if (buttonActiveSince == 0) {
        buttonActiveSince = millis();
    } else if ((millis() - buttonActiveSince > LONG_PRESS_TIME)
                && longPressActive == false) {
          longPressActive = true;
          digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  // turn LED ON
        }
    }

  // Was button active?
  } else {
    // Was Long Press event?
    if (buttonActiveSince > 0) {
      // End Long Press event
      if (longPressActive == true) {
        Serial.println("button-action,2");
        digitalWrite(led, LOW);  // turn LED OFF
        longPressActive = false;

      // End Short Press event
      } else {
        Serial.println("button-action,1");
      }
      buttonActiveSince = 0;
    }
  }

}
```

The following flow chart illustrates the algorithm of this example code.

![Flowchart Push Button](images/push_button_flow_chart.png)

In Arduino IDE, in the top menu 'Tools > Boards' select 'Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560'

Then press the Verify button (green circle with tick).

## 3.3 Wire Push Button and LED

In this example we need three wires, a resistor, an LED and a push button.

![Flowchart Push Button](images/push_button_led_log.svg)

## 3.4 Connect Arduino

Use the USB cable to connect the Arduino to your laptop.

In Arduino IDE, in the top menu Tools > Port select your Arduino

Then press the Flash button to send the code into the Arduino (green circle with right arrow)

In the Arduino IDE, in the top menu 'Tools' open the 'Serial Monitor'.
Look at the input, pressing the push button should turn on the LED and produce a
log in the Serial Monitor.


### Update Python Example

The last step is to adapt the Python code on your laptop to read the Serial input
from the Arduino and forward them to the Data-Centric Design Hub.

You can copy the code from examples/serial_example.py in your wheelchair folder.

In this code, we use the environment variable again to provide the thing id and token.

We need an extra environment variable to specify the serial port. You can find
it on the Arduino IDE, in the top menu Tools > Ports. For example:

```bash
THING_ID=
THING_TOKEN=
SERIAL=/dev/cu.usbmodem14201
```

We are now ready to run the Python code

On Mac

```python
python3 wheelchair/serial_example.py
```

On Windows

Go back to Grafana to visualise the inputs
